    <h1>Sofa in <span> Progress</span></h1>
    <p>The realization of an idea is a process consisting of several essential steps, one of which is shaping the prototype. Long <br> before the final product gains its physical dimensions, it all starts with a vision. Developing a prototype is one of the <br> most fulfilling steps of the process. It does not only allow us to design outside the box but it also develops both our <br> creative and critical thinking.</p>
    <h2>Benefits of prototyping:</h2>
    <h3><span>1.</span> It enables us to test and refine the functionality of the design.</h3>
    <h3><span>2.</span> It makes it possible for us to test how various materials perform.</h3>
    <h3><span>3.</span> It helps us present our idea and explain the whole concept behind the product to a wide range of professionals: an <br> attorney, a packaging expert, a marketing expert, engineers, potential business partners and more.</h3>

        <h1>Initial Concept Drafting</h1>
        <p>Every professional involved in creating and implementing <br> innovative products can confirm that realizing an idea for an <br> avant-garde product is a process requiring dozens of sketches, <br> doodles, drawings and drafts. This is an essential step of building <br> a fully functional final physical production.</p>

        <h1>3D Modeling</h1>
       <p>In the digital era we live in the success of almost all inventions <br> depends on creating extremely accurate computer models. This <br> method can eliminate the majority of errors that might occur in <br> building the prototype. Thanks to our team’s expertise in using <br> specialized software, we can visualize forms and models of any <br> complexity and size.</p>

        <p>At this stage, all technical knowledge is put into action and the <br> machines are getting full steam ahead. This is the moment when <br> we finally see if the physical product will meet our expectations or <br> not. Despite all the research, efforts, accurate measurements and <br> attention to details, the risk of failure always exists.</p>
        <p class="para2">Right after the final product is complete, we start the evaluation <br> process. Some of this step’s key factors cover the assessment of <br> how the product looks and feels, does it have any physical flaws, <br> is it functional, are any material changes necessary, does it pass <br> the endurance testing, etc.</p>
